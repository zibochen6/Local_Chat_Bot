With access to soil moisture and temperature data, we can take actions to make sure the right amount of water is irrigated at the appropriate time, and the plants are in optimal environments which are good for their growth. This Soil Moisture & Temperature Sensor MODBUS-RTU RS485 (S-Soil MT-02A) is designed with industry standards. It incorporates two sensors (soil moistures sensor and s...",

Why use pre-compiled libraries? The pre-compiled library allows to share the functions of the library without exposing the source code. The only limitation of pre-compiled libraries is that they are only valid for boards or MCUs that have been compiled for. Getting Started‚Äã Let's take an Arduino library as example and convert it to pre-compiled library. Here I will use Seeed_Arduino_LIS3DHTR as Arduino library and Wio Terminal as board option.",

These gateways can receive LoRa packets on a specific spreading factor and channel and facilitate the exchange of these packets with the network. Due to their affordability, many users have embarked on building their own single-channel gateways to experiment with LoRa. The XIAO ESP32S3 as host MCU and Wio-SX1262 LoRa radio kit can be configured to function as single channel gateway. This kit offers a practical solution for those interested in delving into LoRa technology and establishing connections to LNS(lora network server).",

OpenCV provides a comprehensive set of tools for this task, including contour detection, edge detection, and polygonal approximation. The process typically begins with image preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion, blurring, and thresholding to enhance shape visibility. The contours extracted from the processed image are then analyzed, and the number of vertices in each contour is used to classify shapes such as circles, triangles, and rectangles. OpenCV's versatility in shape detection makes it a powerful tool for applicati...",
